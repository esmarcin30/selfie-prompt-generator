# Bug Fixes Summary - Selfie Prompt Generator

## Bug #1: Logic Error - Duplicate Options in Dropdown Menus

**Severity**: Medium
**Type**: Logic Error
**Location**: `index.html` lines 122-123, `createField()` function

### Problem Description
The application was creating duplicate entries in dropdown menus when custom options were saved to localStorage. The code combined predefined options with saved options without checking for duplicates.

### Impact
- Users would see duplicate options in dropdown menus
- Poor user experience with cluttered interface
- Potential confusion when selecting options

### Fix Applied
Added duplicate checking using `Set` to ensure unique options before creating dropdown elements.

## Bug #2: Security Issue - URL Injection Vulnerability

**Severity**: High
**Type**: Security Vulnerability
**Location**: `index.html` line 146, `generatePrompt()` function

### Problem Description
The application directly used user input to construct URLs without proper validation or length limits. This created a potential URL injection vulnerability where malicious users could:
- Inject malicious URLs that redirect to dangerous sites
- Create extremely long URLs that could cause browser issues
- Potentially bypass intended functionality

### Impact
- Security risk: potential redirection to malicious websites
- Performance issues with extremely long URLs
- Potential for social engineering attacks

### Fix Applied
Added proper URL validation, length limiting (2000 chars), and domain verification to ensure URLs always point to the intended OpenAI domain.

## Bug #3: Logic Error - Broken Custom Input Handling

**Severity**: Medium
**Type**: User Experience & Logic Error
**Location**: `index.html` lines 125-130, `createField()` function

### Problem Description
The custom input functionality had several critical issues:
1. **Poor UX**: Used blocking `prompt()` dialog which interrupts user flow
2. **Unnecessary delay**: Added confusing 300ms timeout before prompting
3. **Incomplete functionality**: Custom input field was created but not properly utilized
4. **No validation**: No input validation or error handling

### Impact
- Poor user experience with blocking dialogs
- Confusing workflow with unnecessary delays
- Missing functionality for custom input fields
- No proper input validation

### Fix Applied
Implemented proper custom input handling with:
- Smooth inline input fields that appear when "Custom" is selected
- Enter key and blur event handling for saving custom values
- Proper input validation and trimming
- Automatic focus management for better UX

## Summary of Improvements

1. **Enhanced Security**: Added URL validation and injection prevention
2. **Improved Logic**: Fixed duplicate option handling
3. **Better UX**: Replaced blocking dialogs with intuitive input fields
4. **Input Validation**: Added proper trimming and validation
5. **Error Handling**: Added console logging for security validation failures

All fixes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving security, functionality, and user experience.
