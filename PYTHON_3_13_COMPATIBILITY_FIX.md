# Python 3.13 Compatibility Fix - MacBook Deal Tracker

## Problem Resolved
The MacBook Deal Tracker was unable to run due to Python 3.13 compatibility issues with specific package versions:
- **lxml==4.9.3** - Failed to compile with Python 3.13
- **pandas==2.0.3** - Failed to compile with Python 3.13

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Package Versions
Updated `requirements.txt` to use Python 3.13 compatible versions:

```
# Before (Python 3.13 incompatible)
lxml==4.9.3
pandas==2.0.3
requests==2.31.0
beautifulsoup4==4.12.2
python-dotenv==1.0.0
schedule==1.2.0

# After (Python 3.13 compatible)
lxml>=5.2.0
pandas>=2.2.0
requests>=2.31.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.2
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
schedule>=1.2.0
```

### 2. Successfully Installed Packages
All packages now install correctly with Python 3.13.3:
- ✅ lxml 6.0.0
- ✅ pandas 2.3.1
- ✅ requests 2.32.4
- ✅ beautifulsoup4 4.13.4
- ✅ python-dotenv 1.1.1
- ✅ schedule 1.2.2

### 3. Created Missing Configuration Files
